2) Test the functionality of your ImageFile class. Describe the tests you ran as the answer
to this question.
we ran cout<<"test"<<endl; for the two different cases of error and ran write and read for the
{'X', ' ', 'X', ' ', 'X', ' ', 'X', ' ', 'X', '3'} vector to see which cases the vector may fall into.
Every time the test fell into one of the two errors, whe analyzed why it well into that case and modified each
case so that we do not fall into any errors when inputing this example. We also tested for cases when we put
random characters that are not 'X' or ' ' and it returned the correct error output. We also tested the append function
and it returned the correct error.
